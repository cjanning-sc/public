The paper, “Risk Management and Operational Resilience in a Remote Working Environment” highlights possible risks to FIs in the areas of operations, technology and information security, fraud and staff misconduct, and legal and regulatory risks. It also examines the impact on people and culture that may be brought about by remote working. The paper suggests key risk management actions and examples of mitigating controls that FIs should benchmark themselves against. </div><div id="published_year">2021</div><div id="published_month">March</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2021-03-02T10:30:00Z</div><div id="score">24.300488</div></body></html>
