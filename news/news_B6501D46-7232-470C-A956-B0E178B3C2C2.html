With the proposed exemption, card issuers may determine the appropriate credit limits for this higher income group in line with their assessment of the credit worthiness of these individuals. This proposal is part of MAS&rsquo; ongoing process of updating the credit card rules to ensure that they remain appropriate and relevant.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2007-10-01T08:00:00Z</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{b6501d46-7232-470c-a956-b0e178b3c2c2}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2007/mas-invites-comments-on-proposed-exemption-from-maximum-credit-card-limit</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">"https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg"</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">MAS Invites Comments on Proposed Exemption from Maximum Credit Card Limit</div><div id="score">5.51807</div></body></html>
