The guidelines, which take effect immediately, give guidance to fund managers on the operation and marketing of such specialised unit trusts in Singapore. MAS said that both sets of guidelines are in line with international practice and were formulated after taking into account comments received from the local fund management industry.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">1999-10-26T08:00:00Z</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{b95e3ad0-da6a-4bfd-8236-61b7c13aceb8}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/1999/mas-releases-guidelines-for-capital-guaranteed-funds-and-futures-options-funds--26-oct-1999</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">"https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg"</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">MAS Releases Guidelines for Capital Guaranteed Funds and Futures & Options Funds</div><div id="score">4.0600367</div></body></html>
