This second consultation includes revisions to address feedback received from the first consultation published in 2019 and incorporates key learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic. It builds on the policy intent from the first consultation to further emphasise the need for financial institutions to take an end-to-end view in ensuring the continuous delivery of critical business services, and introduce principles and practices that financial institutions can implement to strengthen operational resilience. While this second consultation is on-going, financial institutions should continue to refer to the 2003 guidelines and supplementary guidance.</div><div id="masconsultation_responsedate_tdt">2022-06-06T12:00:00Z</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2021-10-15T12:00:00Z</div><div id="masconsultation_consultationnumber_t">P015 - 2021</div><div id="mas_content_number">P015 - 2021</div><div id="topic_path">Risk Management/Business Continuity,Risk Management/Operational Risk</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{5bb7744e-5cf6-48a3-a52b-3a5385c3b1ae}?lang=en&ver=4&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="masconsultation_startdate_tdt">2021-10-15T12:00:00Z</div><div id="page_url_s">/publications/consultations/2021/second-consultation-paper-on-proposed-revisions-to-guidelines-on-business-continuity-management</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Consultations</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">2021</div><div id="score">29.85857</div></body></html>
