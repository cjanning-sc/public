In line with this, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) today released a consultation paper on a proposed bond seasoning framework. Under this framework, retail investors will be able to purchase bonds initially offered by eligible issuers to institutional and accredited investors, after these bonds have been listed for six months (seasoned bonds). These issuers will also be able to sell to retail investors without issuing a prospectus, additional bonds with the same terms as the seasoned bonds.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2014-09-01T16:58:00Z</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{ef1f8618-5d26-41b4-a2cc-e88a8cad77f1}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2014/making-it-easier-for-retail-investors-to-buy-bonds</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">"https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg"</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">Making It Easier For Retail Investors To Buy Bonds</div><div id="score">8.732222</div></body></html>
