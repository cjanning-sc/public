The swap facilities allow the Federal Reserve to provide US dollar liquidity to financial institutions through central banks in sound, well-managed and systemically important financial centres to help to improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets and to mitigate the spread of difficulties in obtaining US dollar funding.  This has helped to enhance the robustness of the US dollar funding and foreign exchange markets in Singapore by reinforcing confidence among global financial institutions.  MAS has not had to draw on the facility.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2009-06-26T00:00:00Z</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{dc8ca381-5e8c-411f-a8cd-2adb0ef71e10}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2009/mas-announces-extension-of-swap-facility-with-us-federal-reserve-260609</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">Monetary Authority of Singapore Announces Extension of Swap Facility with US Federal Reserve</div><div id="score">6.0437307</div></body></html>
