(LBSF), the swap counterparty for the notes. This is an important development which resolves the legal complexities that had prevented the earlier unwinding of the notes and gives noteholders greater certainty that they will be able to receive the remaining value of their notes.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="published_year">2009</div><div id="published_month">October</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2009-10-01T08:00:00Z</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{e3fe58e6-a476-4bce-979f-6736d9223b42}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2009/mas-welcomes-the-receivers-and-trustee-announcement-of-the-settlement-agreement-for-the-minibond-notes</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">MAS Welcomes the Receivers' and Trustee's  Announcement of the Settlement Agreement for the Minibond Notes</div><div id="score">6.135508</div></body></html>
