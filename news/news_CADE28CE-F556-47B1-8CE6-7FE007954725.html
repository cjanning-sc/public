The regulations spell out the rules for determining whether stakes in non-financial businesses held indirectly by banks through their affiliates have to be divested, and give effect to the policy restricting cyclical shareholding arrangements within banking groups.  The regulations also prescribe the limited forms of property-related activities that banks are permitted to engage in under the anti-commingling policy.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="published_year">2004</div><div id="published_month">May</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2004-05-05T00:00:00Z</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{cade28ce-f556-47b1-8ce6-7fe007954725}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2004/mas-issues-banking-amendment-regulations-2004</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">MAS Issues Banking (Amendment) Regulations 2004</div><div id="score">4.7504997</div></body></html>
