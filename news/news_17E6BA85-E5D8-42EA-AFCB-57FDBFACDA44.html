Such websites falsely claim that Singapore is adopting a cryptocurrency as its official coin and ask readers to provide their personal and financial details to purchase the cryptocurrency. Members of the public are advised to avoid providing any financial or personal information on the forms linked from the website and report such cases to the Police.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2019-01-29T02:00:00Z</div><div id="topic_path">Risk Management/Fraud Risk</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{17e6ba85-e5d8-42ea-afcb-57fdbfacda44}?lang=en&ver=6&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2019/warning-on-fraudulent-websites-soliciting-cryptocurrency-investments</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">Warning on Fraudulent Websites Soliciting “Cryptocurrency” Investments</div><div id="score">15.143053</div></body></html>
