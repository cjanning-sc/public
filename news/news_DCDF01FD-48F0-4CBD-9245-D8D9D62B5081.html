This follows extensive consultation jointly conducted by MAS and the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) with the industry and public in 2006 and 2007, where we received much feedback. MAS and MinLaw carefully considered the feedback so that while we apply a common set of rules for unsecured credit to financial institutions (FIs) regulated by MAS and moneylenders regulated by MinLaw, differences between financial institutions and moneylenders were also recognised.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="mas_date_tdt">2009-02-25T08:00:00Z</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{dcdf01fd-48f0-4cbd-9245-d8d9d62b5081}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2009/mas-implements-revised-unsecured-credit-rules-for-financial-institutions</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">"https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg"</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">MAS Implements Revised Unsecured Credit Rules for Financial Institutions</div><div id="score">5.934407</div></body></html>
