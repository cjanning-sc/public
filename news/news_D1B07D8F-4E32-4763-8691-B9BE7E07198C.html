The survey report is attached.The latest survey shows that total assets under management increased by a significant 11% in 2001. As at end-2001, total assets under management was S$307.0 billion, compared with S$276.2 billion at end-2000. Assets under management at end-2001 comprised S$180.7 billion of discretionary assets managed in Singapore and S$126.3 billion of non-discretionary assets. Total discretionary AUM grew by 9% from S$166.4 billion at end-2000 to S$180.7 billion at end-2001. The increase in the AUM figures can be attributed to the inflow of new funds, in part due to fund managers increasing their allocations to Asia in 2001. Furthermore, the consolidation of the Asian investment operations of several global fund managers into Singapore has also led to the increase of funds under management here.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="published_year">2002</div><div id="published_month">June</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{d1b07d8f-4e32-4763-8691-b9be7e07198c}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2002/singapore-asset-management-industry-continues-to-see-steady-growth--5-june-2002</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">Singapore Asset Management Industry Continues to See Steady Growth</div><div id="score">4.4234705</div></body></html>
