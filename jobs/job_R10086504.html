The selected candidates will be responsible for overall technical leadership for the SEIT department Mission Systems Engineering (MSE) and/or Systems Design (SD). This role encompasses team leadership, management, and technical performance. Department assignments will be made at the conclusion of the interview process, based on the candidates’ fit and preference.</h3><h3><br />NGMS is a leading global provider, manufacturer and integrator of advanced, secure and agile software-defined systems and solutions. Our products range from advanced sensing technologies to state-of-the-art targeting and tracking systems that are deployed in Electro-Optical Infrared (EOIR) and Radio Frequency Electronic Warfare (RFEW) systems. These systems are designed, developed, built, integrated, and tested by the capable folks at our company to protect the lives of U.S. and Allied warfighters in present and future conflicts. Our SEIT organization provides complex avionics systems in Targeting, EOIR, and RF technology areas. The Staff Engineer Systems opportunity is available in two disciplines within Rolling Meadows SEIT of Central Region:</h3><h3><br />Mission Systems Engineering: This department includes SEIT Leads, Architects, and Modeling &amp; Simulation engineers.</h3><h3>The SEIT Lead provides leadership in applying the core principles of systems engineering in order to deliver innovative, affordable, highly reliable systems solutions that meet customer needs, key performance parameters, and program execution goals. The SEIT Lead will lead multi-disciplined engineering teams from business capture through system design and then integration and test of highly complex technical systems. The SEIT Lead must be familiar with program scheduling and managing customer deliverables.</h3><h3>The Architect must have an understanding of how our systems architecture design process meets our mission level goals. Assignments may also include analysis and trade studies of product line architectures using analytical models and mission level simulations.</h3><h3>A primary task for a modeling and simulations engineer is software development of in-house models and algorithms. Strong domain knowledge combined with valuable software development skills are required to produce the accurate models that drive the critical analysis needed to design our future systems.</h3><h3><br />Systems Design: Engineers in this department are involved with creating and refining Model Based System Engineering products (System behavioral models, Use Case realizations, State Machines, etc.), generation and update of System and sub-system level specifications in DOORS, including requirements traceability, creation of Verification Cross Reference Matrices (VCRM), verification traceability (tracing requirements to test <span>plans/procedures/results),</span> and update and maintenance of system drawings and documents. As a part of the SEIT team, a Systems Design engineer is exposed to the front-end Systems Engineering process and coordinates across many disciplines to ensure that the system description and requirements are properly and thoroughly defined and captured. Your role will include research, design, development and simulation of Electronic Warfare systems, and defining and developing processing algorithms for real-time implementation. Your expertise in RF and/or Electro-Optical system design and analysis, digital signal and or image processing and system modeling and simulation are desired for this position. During the interview process, our team will seek to understand both your experience and preferences in order to determine which area provides the best opportunity for you to succeed. These groups and engineering roles with SEIT provide a great opportunity to work alongside a variety of other Systems, Hardware, Software and Mechanical engineers to successfully execute on mission-critical programs.</h3><h3></h3><h3>Position Summary / Responsibilities, Staff Engineer Systems:<br />Performs technical planning, model based system integration, verification and validation, cost and risk, and supportability and effectiveness analyses for total systems. Analyses are performed at all levels of total system product to include: concept, design, fabrication, test, installation, operation, maintenance and disposal in model-based environments. Ensures the logical and systematic conversion of customer or product requirements into total systems solutions that acknowledge technical, schedule, and cost constraints. Performs functional analysis, timeline analysis, detail trade studies, requirements allocation and interface definition studies to translate customer requirements into hardware and software specifications.</h3><h3></h3><h3><span><span><b><span>What We Can Offer You:</span></b></span></span></h3><h3></h3><h3><span><span><span>Northrop Grumman provides a comprehensive benefits package and a work environment that encourages your growth and supports the mutual success of our people and our company.
