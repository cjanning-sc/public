Our Sonar Innovation Lab needs someone with advanced skills in digital and analog circuit design. Tasks will include designing custom circuit card assemblies, electrical integration and documentation as well as guiding existing technology into adjacent opportunities and continuing to improve the performance of the SONAR product line. This individual will be responsible for continuing the development and focused application of our SASTM product line, a fully embedded, interferometric, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) boasting very low SWaP and real time beamforming. Additional responsibilities will involve supporting legacy SONAR systems, leading troubleshooting, repair, manufacture and designing system upgrades.</p><p></p><p>The ideal candidate will quickly become a key contributor to internal and customer funded R&amp;D efforts pushing SONAR systems technology forward by incorporating the latest industry advances. Individual will also ensure integrated designs are ready for manufacture, for engineering follow through production addressing issues that arise within cost and schedule constraints, and for factory acceptance testing (FAT), both bench level and within an Acoustic Test Facility. Once through FAT, this individual may be asked to travel to participate in field integration and characterization testing. Familiarity with sonar/sensor data analysis and interpretation of data against requirements is encouraged. This position will be located at our Rockford, MD facility.</p><p></p><p><b>Basic Qualifications for Electronics Engineer:</b></p><ul><li>Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineer, Computer Engineering or related field</li><li>2&#43; years of relevant experience or 0 years with Master’s degree</li><li>Experience using CCA design and layout software</li><li>Experience simulating electrical designs using SPICE or equivalent modeling software</li><li>Eligibility to obtain a security clearance.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Basic Qualifications for Principal Electronics Engineer:</b></p><ul><li>Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineer, Computer Engineering or related field - 5&#43; years of relevant experience or 2&#43; years with Master’s degree or 0 years with PhD</li><li> Experience using CCA design and layout software</li><li>Experience simulating electrical designs using SPICE or equivalent modeling software</li><li>Eligibility to obtain a security clearance.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Preferred Qualifications: </b></p><ul><li>Experience in FPGA (Xilinx) enabled circuit designs</li><li>Design, production, test and deployment experience with SONAR, RADAR or communications systems preferred.</li><li>Demonstrated skill using Mentor Graphics Designer/Expedition for CCA design and layout</li><li>Utilize SPICE for circuit modeling and system design verification</li><li>Expertise in electronics design for sensor data collection</li></ul></div><div id="job_state">Illinois</div><div id="relocation_eligible">Yes</div><div id="virtual_telecommute">Hybrid</div><div id="creation_date">2023-01-19</div><div id="pay_range_maximum">109302</div><div id="creation_month">January</div></body></html>
