Our team is chartered with providing the skills, innovative technologies to develop, design, produce and sustain optimized product lines across the sector while providing a decisive advantage to the warfighter.  Come be a part of our mission!</span></p><p></p><p><span>We are looking for you to join our team as a </span><b>Principal RF Systems Engineer / Senior Principal RF Systems Engineer</b><span> based out of </span><b>Milwaukee, WI</b><span>. </span></p><p></p><p><u><b>What You’ll get to Do:</b></u></p><p><span>Principal Systems Engineer/Sr. Principal Systems Engineer opportunities are available in three disciplines:</span></p><p></p><p><span>Systems Design: Tasking can include creating and refining Model Based System Engineering products (System behavioral models, Use Case realizations, State Machines, etc.), generation and update of System and sub-system level specifications in DOORS, including requirements traceability, creation of Verification Cross Reference Matrices (VCRM), verification traceability (tracing requirements to test plans/procedures/results),and update and maintenance of system drawings and documents. As a part of the SEIT team, a Systems Design engineer is exposed to the front-end Systems engineering process and coordinates across many disciplines to ensure that the system description and requirements are properly and thoroughly defined and captured.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Modeling &amp; Simulation: Assignments include analysis and trades of product line architectures using analytical models and mission level simulations. A primary task for a modeling and simulations engineer is software development of in-house models and algorithms. Strong domain knowledge combined with valuable software development skills are required to produce the accurate models that drive the critical analysis needed to design our future systems. As a member of the SEIT team, a Modeling and Simulations engineer gains a deep understanding of how our systems architecture design process meets our mission level goals.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Integration &amp; Test: Efforts may include generation of test plans, test procedures, test automation, test reports, and execution of integration test activities in System Integration Labs (SILs) or offsite locations. As a part of the SEIT team, an Integration &amp; Test engineer gains an understanding of the Systems Engineering process across a product&#39;s lifecycle and gains a full appreciation for how the avionics systems operate.</span></p><p></p><p><span>During the interview process, our team will seek to understand both your experience and preferences in order to determine which area provides the best opportunity for you to succeed.
