We work in conjunction with ACME’s Strategy and Business Development organization to evaluate the performance of existing and candidate system designs in representative operational environments. Our work influences the investment decisions of our senior leadership and customer program offices. The Modeling and Simulation discipline itself is a mesh of many other fields (e.g. Systems Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Software Engineering, etc.) and frequently collaborates across functional disciplines, offering a unique opportunity to obtain a broad understanding of many areas or to more narrowly focus on developing a deep expertise in any one of the relevant fields.</p><p></p><p>In this role, you will be asked to work in a small team environment to conduct research, develop models, and perform analysis of a wide variety of system types across multiple domains (friendly and adversary; ground, air and space) to drive the development of clean-sheet requirements, refine existing program system requirements, and influence the pursuit of future technologies and capabilities. You will work with air vehicle and subsystem engineers, as well as with program and customer leadership, to recommend candidate designs, and to develop Concepts of Operation (CONOPs) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) at the system, mission, and campaign levels.</p><p></p><p>The selected candidate with be responsible for developing new and/or integrate existing system simulation frameworks, performance models and algorithms, threat models and command and control models.</p><p></p><p><b>Essential Functions:  </b></p><ul><li>Develops software to model behavior of systems in real-time and constructive simulations.  </li><li>Develops, integrates, and uses advanced graphical user interfaces and visualization tools.</li><li>Models operational environments, performs trade studies via computer simulation and recommends alternative architectures.</li><li>Performs operational analysis and mission effectiveness analysis.</li><li>Create and apply knowledge of tactics, techniques, and procedures to support blue/red kill chains across multiple security environments, advanced programs, architectures, and platforms.</li><li>Provide blue/red tactics and CONOPS modeling, simulation, and analysis support to accomplish long-term objectives related to program development, execution, and related research and development projects.</li><li>Perform mission engineering activities to ensure continuity between desired operational capabilities and delivered system performance, through the Systems Engineering “V”. Ensure performance capabilities of new systems and architectures are traded against cost and mission requirements; develop mission relevant scenarios; assess operational effectiveness of existing and emerging systems and capabilities in representative operational environments.</li><li>Solicit input from various stakeholders, synthesize data, and communicate results to various levels of leadership within the organization.</li></ul><p></p><p>The selected candidate should thrive in a fast-paced work environment with high expectations, significantly diverse assignments, collaborative/team settings across all levels.</p><p></p><p><b>Basic Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>Bachelor’s Degree in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics) discipline from an accredited university and 2 years of related engineering experience, or a Master&#39;s Degree and 0 years of experience.</li><li>Experience in at least one of the following areas:<ul><li>Modeling and Simulation of Missiles, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), Air and/or Space platforms</li><li>Analysis at the Survivability, Lethality, Vulnerability, Engagement, and/or Mission Level</li><li>Red and/or Blue CONOPs and TTPs</li></ul></li><li>A current active in-scope U.S. Government DoD Secret security clearance or higher is required to start, with the ability to obtain and maintain Special Program Access (PAR/SAP).</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><b>Preferred Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>Operational military background in any of the following:<ul><li>Fighter or Bomber Pilot</li><li>Electronic Warfare Officer/Weapons Systems Officer</li><li>Air Battle Manager</li><li>Intelligence Officer/Analyst</li><li>Joint Duty Officer</li><li>Air Defense Artillery</li></ul></li><li>Experience with system of systems modeling tools: AFSIM, Suppressor, or Brawler.</li><li>Familiarity with AGILE, MBSE, and/or system architecture.</li><li>Effective project management skills and good communication.</li><li>Experience with version control tools (Bitbucket, GitHub, Gitlab, etc.).</li><li>Strong interpersonal and leadership skills.</li><li>Excellent communications skills, including the ability to present and brief technical date to all levels of leadership within the organization and U.S. Government.</li><li>A current active in-scope U.S. Government DoD Top Secret security clearance with current or previous Special Program Access (SAP)/SCI.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>The health and safety of our employees and their families is a top priority. With the continuing impacts of COVID-19 around the world, we are taking action to protect the health and well-being of our colleagues and maintain the safety of the communities where we operate.
