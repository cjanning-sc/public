Specifically, actions have been taken to terminate the swaps in the underlying securities for series 1 to 8 of the Minibond notes programme.  This removes the risk of credit events in the underlying securities and helps to preserve the value of the underlying collateral.  This action is not necessary for series 9 and 10 as the underlying securities for these notes are corporate bonds and have no swaps.</div><div id="mas_datetitle_s">Published Date</div><div id="published_year">2008</div><div id="published_month">November</div><div id="_uniqueid">sitecore://web/{63cdb1f9-4959-4b37-9d3b-220fac2b0bcd}?lang=en&ver=1&ndx=mas_search_index</div><div id="page_url_s">/news/media-releases/2008/actions-taken-to-protect-interests-of-noteholders-of-the-lehman-minibond-notes-programme</div><div id="mas_searchthumbnailimage_sm">https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/stock-images/lower-res-images-for-website/news.jpg</div><div id="mas_contenttype_s">Media Releases</div><div id="navigation_title_string_s">Actions Taken to Protect Interests of Noteholders of the Lehman Minibond Notes Programme</div><div id="score">5.8427777</div></body></html>
