Our pioneering and inventive spirit has enabled us to be at the forefront of many technological advancements in our nation’s history - from the first flight across the Atlantic Ocean, to stealth bombers, to landing on the moon. We look for people who have bold new ideas, courage, and a pioneering spirit to join forces to invent the future and have fun along the way. Our culture thrives on intellectual curiosity, cognitive diversity, and bringing your whole self to work — and, we have an insatiable drive to do what others think is impossible. Our employees are not only part of history, but they’re also making history.</p><p></p><p>As a developer of RF sensors for some of the most advanced systems in the U.S. arsenal, ACME Engineering is a world leader in advanced sensor systems design, engineering, and manufacturing. These include sensors for air dominance platforms (such as the F-16, F-22, F-35), bomber and strike programs (such as B-1B), airborne / maritime / ground-based surveillance missions (E-3 AWACS, E-7 MESA, TPS-80 G/ATOR, SPQ-9B, and UAV systems such as Global Hawk), as well as restricted programs and missions. We offer the opportunity to join a team to help solve issues from the field and drive new solutions into next generation sensor systems.</p><p></p><p>ACME Engineering’s Sensor Solutions Systems Engineering (S3E) organization has a need for a Systems Engineer to support the design, development, integration, and verification on some of our most advanced RF sensors. ACME Engineering prioritizes mentoring and growth for our engineering team, and successful candidates will have the opportunity to work with industry-leading sensor and system architects with 20&#43; years of industry experience to build their career in systems engineering.</p><p></p><p><b>Roles &amp; Responsibilities: </b></p><p>This position is primarily engaged in the development and fielding of sensor modes for advanced multi-function RF subsystems. Key modes of operation include, but is not limited to, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for ground imaging applications, electronic protection (EP) to mitigate the most advanced adversary electronic attack, long-range search and track waveforms to provide critical situational awareness to our customers, and electronic attack (EA) to defeat the most advanced adversary sensor system. Early in the system lifecycle, systems engineers develop parametric representations, visualizations, and data driven analysis to support sensor requirements definition and use case validation. Progressing past analysis and design, ACME Engineering Systems Engineers also support the integration of sensor modes from digital simulation environments to laboratories and our on-site fleet of specially modified test aircraft. Throughout this process, Sensor Systems Engineers engage with our customers to balance their functional and performance requirements with other sensor functionality to enable true multi-function operation.</p><p></p><p>At the Systems Engineer (T02) level, the idea candidate will be expected to work with some oversight from staff engineers and mentors to independently solve technical challenges. Systems Engineers at this level will also have some interactions across discipline and organizational boundaries as well as customer interaction through presentations and working group meetings.</p><p></p><p>The candidate will perform technical planning, system integration, verification and validation, cost and risk, and supportability and effectiveness analyses for total systems. Analyses are performed at all levels of total system product to include concept, design, fabrication, test, installation, operation, maintenance, and disposal. The candidate will ensure the logical and systematic conversion of customer or product requirements into total systems solutions that acknowledge technical, schedule, and cost constraints. The candidate will perform functional analysis, timeline analysis, detail trade studies, requirements allocation and interface definition studies to translate customer requirements into hardware and software specifications.</p><p></p><p><b>Basic Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>Must have an active DoD Secret security clearance prior to starting</li><li>Must be Special Access Program (SAP) eligible</li><li>Bachelor&#39;s degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Physics with 2 years of related experience (see <b>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</b>)<ul><li>Or, 0 years of experience with a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Physics.</li></ul></li><li>Experience with sensor waveform design, digital beamforming, adaptive processing, and/or algorithm development</li><li>Experience with MATLAB, Python, C&#43;&#43;, or equivalent programming/analysis languages</li><li>Experience with RF signals processing or RF applications</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Preferred Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>Active DoD Top Secret Clearance and prior experience with Special Access Programs (SAP)</li><li>Proficiency in signal processing or RF applications</li><li>Proficiency with sensor waveform design, digital beamforming, adaptive processing, and/or algorithm development</li></ul><p></p><p><b>As a full-time employee of ACME Engineering Mission Systems, you are eligible for our robust benefits package including:</b></p><ul><li>Medical, Dental &amp; Vision coverage</li><li>401k</li><li>Educational Assistance</li><li>Life Insurance</li><li>Employee Assistance Programs &amp; Work/Life Solutions</li><li>Paid Time Off</li><li>Health &amp; Wellness Resources</li><li>Employee Discounts</li></ul><p></p><p>For more information about our benefits, please visit <a href="https://totalrewards.acmeengineering.com/" target="_blank">https://totalrewards.acmeengineering.com/</a>.</p></div><div id="job_state">Illinois</div><div id="relocation_eligible">Yes</div><div id="virtual_telecommute">No</div><div id="creation_date">2022-11-21</div><div id="pay_range_maximum">113696</div><div id="creation_month">November</div></body></html>
