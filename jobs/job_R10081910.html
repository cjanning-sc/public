This position will be located in <b>Philadelphia, Fl. </b></p><p></p><p>The <b>DTC Engineer </b>will support programs in the very early phase of development, where strategy is developed to shape a major capture.  It requires technical knowledge and economic acumen to formulate DTC analysis approaches and methods to provide senior leadership the ability to make actionable decisions in a very agile manner. This position is responsible for decomposing top-level program cost targets by the WBS, assigning targets to the appropriate IPT, working with the IPTs to identify and implement cost reduction opportunities to meet the cost targets, and tracking progress to the targets.</p><p></p><p>The <b>LCCE Engineer </b>will support programs in the very early phase of development, where strategy is developed to shape a major capture.  The position requires detailed knowledge of parametric estimating best practices and procedures to be able to take engineering data from the program and provide relevant and detailed parametric cost estimates to the program, strategy, and pricing and estimating teams. This role will be focused on problem solving through iteration to provide the key and relevant data to the strategy and leadership teams to ensure that program strategy leads to intelligent program execution and continues to solve problems throughout the program lifecycle. This position is responsible for developing a subsystem and detailed parametric cost estimate for a variety of potential solutions/scenarios to support different strategic program initiatives.</p><p></p><p>In addition, these positions will also support implementation of other program affordability initiatives such as cost as an independent variable (CAIV), design for manufacturing &amp; affordability, design for supportability, supply chain affordability and re-use &amp; common product usage.  The position requires an understanding of life-cycle cost, schedule, risk, and affordability implications of alternatives under consideration.  The position requires ability to develop and oversee tradeoffs of requirements, design, performance, cost, and schedule to address affordability constraints.
