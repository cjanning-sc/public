Approximately 1/4th of ACME Engineering’s 90,000 employees self-identify as veterans, and more than 1,600 are reservists.   The ACME Engineering Military Internship Program (ACME-MIP) is an approved SkillBridge Program under Dept. of Defense Instruction 1322.29 .The ACME-MIP program is an opportunity for transitioning service members to gain valuable civilian work experience through an individual internship during their last 6 months of service, for up to 180 days. The ACME Engineering Military internship Program is open to all ranks and experience levels. SkillBridge participants are not eligible for compensation from ACME Engineering, as they continue to receive military compensation and benefits as active-duty service <span>members. Responsibilities</span> for this internship position are:   ACME Engineering Corporation (ACME) has developed the ACME Engineering – Military Internship Program (DoD SkillBridge) utilizing the DoDI guidance for SkillBridge.  During this program the service member will be on-site at his or her host company performing an individual internship in an entry to mid-level career type role. The service member will be on the job training supporting a work schedule equivalent to 40hrs per week. </p><p></p><p>Outlined below are the Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes for the program.  </p><p>Goals – Provide transitioning service members fellowship-style job skills training during the last portion(s) of their military commitment. This program is specifically designed to offer internships that result in the potential to transition to a full-time opportunity as the conclusion of the training.  Interns will serve as a pipeline for high-speed, motivated military candidates into ACME.</p><p>Objectives - Service Members who complete the Intern program will be highly-trained, capable, future employees that align to the specific needs of the organization and are prepared to meet the ACME mission “Defining Possible” on Day 1.  This program provides a comprehensive internship experience including professional development, networking with leadership, and training specifically focused on ACME leadership principles, company history, customer/stakeholder engagement, product and service overview, and core job responsibilities.</p><p>Outcome – Offer transitioning service member a rewarding opportunity to join the ACME Engineering team.  </p><p></p><p>DoD SkillBridge Eligibility:  </p><ul><li><span>Meets DoD SkillBridge Qualifications as per DODI 1322.29</span></li><li><span>Has served at least 180 days on active duty</span></li><li><span>Is within 12 months of separation or retirement</span></li><li><span>Will receive an honorable discharge</span></li><li><span>Has taken any service TAPS/TGPS</span></li><li><span>Has attended or participated in an ethics brief within the last 12 months </span></li><li><span>Received Unit Commander (first O-4/Field Grade commander in chain of command) written authorization and approval to participate in DoD SkillBridge Program prior to start of internship.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Job Description -</b></p><p>At the heart of Defining Possible is our commitment to missions.
