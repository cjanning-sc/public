The role encompasses both Orbit Analysis (that works to apply skills in orbital dynamics, mission analysis, space vehicle design, ground system design, systems engineering, and operations to design, build, and operate space based systems) and Orbit Determination (that works to apply skills in orbital dynamics, orbit estimation, measurement systems, space vehicle design, ground system design, systems engineering, and operations to reconstruct and predict the orbit of a space vehicle).  Orbital dynamics is used to simulate mission scenarios and to understand how mission needs drive requirements on the orbit design and orbit maintenance. The analysis is also used to understand how orbit requirements drive space vehicle (mass, propulsion, power, ACS, etc.) and payload design (sensitivity, FOV, revisit, memory, error budgets, etc.) in many areas.</p><p></p><p>Some key domain knowledge areas include:</p><ul><li><p>Orbit dynamics</p></li><li><p>Key orbit trade driving factors</p></li><li><p>Typical operational orbit products</p></li><li><p>Beginning of life launch and orbit injections strategies</p></li><li><p>End of life planning strategies</p></li><li><p>Space environmental factors</p></li><li><p>Space vehicle state measurement systems that may be onboard the vehicle, reside on the ground, or use assets in space and can include measurement types such as ranging, Doppler, GPS, optical measurements or many others.</p></li><li><p>Estimation methods, filtering, statistics in order to calculate a reconstructed orbit based on the measurements</p></li><li><p>Tools STK, Matlab, Python, ability to learn in-house software products</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Additional Thread responsibilities include:</p><p>perform system level verification plan management, performance analysis, TPM management,  requirements decomposition, system verification planning &amp; sell-off, trade studies, cross-project and customer coordination, database development / population / audit, support to hardware and software test development, and development of Mathematical Algorithm Requirements (MARs).</p><p></p><p>Northrop Grumman offers a competitive and robust benefits program.
