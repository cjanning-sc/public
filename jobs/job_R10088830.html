Superconducting electronics form the core of our technology, with development thrusts in both quantum and classical logic. Our quantum computing activities include the development of superconducting devices for both quantum annealing and gate-model quantum computation. Our classical computing activities focus on energy-efficient computation using our patented superconducting digital logic technology, RQL. With a well-established impressive performance this technology is appealing for a variety of immediate applications and future research possibilities at a time when Moore’s law is dramatically slowing. You’ll work in a fast-paced team environment alongside a broad array of scientists and engineers to make these design solutions a reality.</p><p></p><p>We are seeking motivated Analog/Mixed Signal Integrated Circuit (IC) Design Engineers to join our team in design and layout of custom digital superconducting circuits. You will use your skills as an IC designer while learning about superconducting circuit design. Tasks will include schematic capture, circuit simulation, circuit layout, physical verification (LVS, DRC), and parasitic extraction for a variety of superconducting circuits. The right candidate will be comfortable in a dynamic environment with rapidly developing technologies and tools. The candidate must have some experience in custom circuit design, preferably with Cadence Virtuoso. Experience with modeling circuit performance using Spice tools or ADE/Spectre, and/or experience with EM software such as HFSS, Momentum, Clarity or CST is highly desirable. Familiarity with quantum information is a plus. The candidate must be able to take a design from concept through modeling, layout and verification and create a test plan based on circuit requirements.
