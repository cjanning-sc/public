Superconducting electronics forms the core of our technology, with a focus on energy-efficient computation using our patented superconducting digital logic technology, Reciprocal Quantum Logic (RQL). On a gate-for-gate basis, RQL consumes orders of magnitude less power than CMOS while running at significantly higher clock speeds. The Advanced Capabilities division seeks experienced test engineers to develop these technologies into high-performance computing systems. You’ll work in a fast-paced team environment alongside physicists, design engineers, and superconducting foundry engineers to make these technologies a reality.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><p><br />Lead and/or contribute directly, working on design and analysis of signal integrity and electromagnetic effects in highly complex high frequency, high dynamic range mixed signal systems in a very collaborative and innovative research and development environment.</p><p></p><p>Perform analytical studies of electronic systems (integrated circuits, chip-level packaging, interposers, printed circuit boards, connectors, etc.) to support design tradeoffs.</p><p></p><p>Design and analysis activities include electromagnetic modeling (e.g. SSN, ISI, crosstalk, EMC/EMI) for packaging parasitic estimation, associated interconnect, PCBA and filters.
