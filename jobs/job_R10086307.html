This position is paid hourly with no benefits.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Job Description Summary:</b></p><p></p><p>The development of smart armament systems, designed to increase the competitive advantage of our armed forces, is accelerating. This has increased the need for a structural analyst who has a passion for technology development, paired with demonstrated expertise in design excellence. This team member will drive to continually outperform the competition and exceed customer expectations while acting with integrity, loyalty, and respect.</p><p></p><p>As a Staff Engineer the analyst will utilize thermal and structures analysis tools to aid the Armament Systems design team with the development of smart weapons systems. Analytical support of the mechanical design process typically requires any number of finite element analysis approaches. The candidate shall be able to assess the design problem, work with the Subject Matter Expert to formulate an analysis approach and utilize a suite of tools ranging from linear static to non-linear dynamic of both the implicit and explicit solution types. In addition, implicit dynamic solution types such as modal, harmonic, spectrum and random vibration may be required to support modeling the entire design life cycle.</p><p></p><p>In addition to structural analysis, thermal loads often need to be considered. The thermal loading can have a variety of sources including aero heating from hypersonic ballistic applications.</p><p></p><p>The Staff Engineer will also need to provide additional design support using other structural analysis tools.  These tools can include NASGRO or AFGROW to provide data for critical crack analysis and NDT inspection.  Experience with other tools for formalized failure analysis and root cause analysis will be a positive capability.</p><p><br />Experience with metallic and conventional molded plastic materials is required but knowledge of molded and wound fiber reinforced plastics and their modeling would be desired. Reinforced plastic analysis experience with application to printed circuit boards a plus.</p><p><br /><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><p><br />• Work with our Subject Matter Experts to develop a finite element analysis approach and solution to our thermal and structural problems based upon an understanding of the technical principals and determine the analysis type and tools required to evaluate a wide variety of numerical modeling problems which utilize a variety of materials including composites.<br />• Required work flow includes the development of structural models, meshing, selection of boundary conditions and constraints, selection of applicable material properties, selection of proper simulation code and methodology, interpretation of analytical results, and recommendation for design improvements.<br />• Support innovation by applying the most effective analysis technology to new smart munition product development.<br />• Become part of the product team and form close working relationships by understanding the whole system function and presenting solutions and design direction to the design community in an insightful and timely manner.</p><p>• Work with our materials team to characterize materials for use in all types of analysis.</p><p></p><p>Basic Required Skills:</p><ul><li>20 Years with BS; 15 Years with PhD in Mechanical Engineering,</li><li>Prior experience utilizing thermal and structural analysis to solve static and dynamic problems with implicit and explicit solution methods,</li><li>Critical crack analysis, experience with NASGRO or AFGROW.</li></ul><p></p><p><span>Preferred Skills:</span></p><ul><li>Preferred experience with finite element codes ANSYS, ABAQUS, LS-DYNA,</li><li><span>Fatigue analysis with commercial finite fatigue solutions such as NCODE or fe-safe,</span></li><li><span>Formal failure analysis/root cause analysis experience,</span></li><li><span>Structural analysis of molded and wound composite components as well as the characterization of composite constitutive models,</span></li><li><span>Use of the solid modeling tools / PLM tool CREO or Siemens NX,</span></li><li><span>Use of the explicit FEA code EPIC for penetration modeling.</span></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><div id="job_state">Minnesota</div><div id="relocation_eligible">No</div><div id="virtual_telecommute">Yes</div><div id="creation_date">2022-12-20</div><div id="pay_range_maximum">195415</div><div id="creation_month">December</div></body></html>
