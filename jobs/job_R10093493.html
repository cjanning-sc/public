This position is located in Des Moines, VA and Lexington, AZ in our Tactical Space Systems Division. The specific responsibilities of this position will be to manage the technical and functional interfaces of one or more hosted payload to the bus system. Work products include Development of port-specific ICD’s and managing giver-receiver materials, review and approval of bus accommodation documents, development of functional and performance test scripts with the payload vendor, identification and tailoring of mechanical and environmental constraints and requirements. Analysis roles include supporting the science, experiment, and mission planning for the payload. Position will evaluate mission performance and orbital operation of the payload(s).</p><p></p><p><b>Mission Overview:</b></p><p></p><p>The ESPAStar line of vehicles is a highly dynamic, schedule aggressive line of vehicles that are the freight train to space. The mission is configured in a product line approach, with the basis of each program a build-to-print spacecraft bus that serves as a hosting platform for 6 ports worth of payloads – sometimes approaching 12-20 payloads. Every vehicle has a unique payload loadout, and every payload brings new missions, new technologies, and new customers. We’re looking for people that are looking to work responsive space, be vendor and customer facing, and help contribute to both a specific mission and a product line.</p><p></p><p><b>Duties/Responsibilities:</b></p><ul><li><p>Creates system requirements and manages both requirement changes in the Requirements Management databases under self direction using established guidelines for a small project.</p></li><li><p>Creates and manages both original and revised specification/interface definition documents for a project and expedites documents through signature approval process.</p></li><li><p>Creates and manages the requirements verification methods and database provided to the customer, to ensure data products are current, as the system design/build matures, that it satisfies each system requirement.</p></li><li><p>Creates and modifies project level management tracking reports.</p></li><li><p>Participates and supports proposal-writing efforts for Systems Engineering for a portion of a project.</p></li><li><p>Provides data to and manages risk management (identifies potential risks and develops mitigation strategies)and trade study processes for a portion of a project.</p></li><li><p>Creates and manages changes to Functional/Logical/Physical Model of System Architecture descriptions under self direction using established guidelines.</p></li><li><p>Creates and manages System Representations under self direction using established guidelines.</p></li><li><p>Technical Resource Budgets and Configuration Control Board participation.</p></li><li><p>Leads aspects of system design, analyses, interface verification, testing, major failure/anomaly resolution or mission operations.</p></li><li><p>Creates and manages changes to system or subsystem analytical models under self direction using established guidelines.
