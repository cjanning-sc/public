These include radars for air dominance platforms (such as the F-22, Joint Strike Fighter, F-16), bomber and strike programs (such as B-1B), airborne / maritime / ground-based surveillance missions (AWACS, MESA, G/ATOR and UAV systems such as Global Hawk), as well as restricted programs and missions.</span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span><span><span>ACME Engineering has needs for Senior Sensor Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&amp;A) Developers on a major development program with a simulation-based system/software development, integration, test and verification activities.  The program is a leader in digital transformation in the MS sector and Springfield campus, leveraging a <span>model-/simulation-based</span> approach including DevOps principles and High Performance Computing. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Qualified candidates will have opportunities to accelerate the delivery of sensor capability to our customers through the development and use of advanced models and simulations of RF sensors and the interactions with the environment.</span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span><span><span><b>Roles &amp; Responsibilities:</b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>The position involves Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&amp;A) of advanced sensor systems using C&#43;&#43; object-oriented design, advanced data structures and test driven development. Additional experience developing with Python is desired for large scale data analytics, probability and statistics, including the application of design of experiment techniques for the evaluation of system performance. The position also includes the integration of MS&amp;A with operational flight software, collecting and analyzing data from laboratory or flight tests, the verification and validation of simulation performance against flight test data, and formally verifying that the models meet specified requirements. The position requires high technical rigor required to produce publication quality reports which define the foundation for simulation credibility across all stakeholders and provide the artifacts to support formal simulation Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VVA).</span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span><span><span>Candidates should be highly motivated developers who can work independently to develop software, design documentation and model V&amp;V artifacts. The sensor systems, simulation software and workflow is fairly complex therefore strong problem solving skills are desired.
