Department assignments will be made at the conclusion of the interview process, based on the candidates’ fit and preference.</p><p><br />NGMS is a leading global provider, manufacturer and integrator of advanced, secure and agile software-defined systems and solutions. Our products range from advanced sensing technologies to state-of-the-art targeting and tracking systems that are deployed in Electro-Optical Infrared (EOIR) and Radio Frequency Electronic Warfare (RFEW) systems. These systems are designed, developed, built, integrated, and tested by the capable folks at our company to protect the lives of U.S. and Allied warfighters in present and future conflicts. Our SEIT organization provides complex avionics systems in Targeting, EOIR, and RF technology areas. The Staff Engineer Systems opportunity is available in two disciplines within Milwaukee SEIT of Central Region:</p><p><br />Mission Systems Engineering: This department includes SEIT Leads, Architects, and Modeling &amp; Simulation engineers. The Architect must have an understanding of how our systems architecture design process meets our mission level goals. Assignments may also include analysis and trade studies of product line architectures using analytical models and mission level simulations. The architects work closely with software, hardware, and firmware engineers to integrate a product design.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Position Summary / Responsibilities, Staff Engineer Systems:<br />Performs technical planning, system integration, verification and validation, cost and risk, and supportability and effectiveness analyses for total systems. Analyses are performed at all levels of total system product to include: concept, design, fabrication, test, installation, operation, maintenance and disposal. Ensures the logical and systematic conversion of customer or product requirements into total systems solutions that acknowledge technical, schedule, and cost constraints. Performs functional analysis, timeline analysis, detail trade studies, requirements allocation and interface definition studies to translate customer requirements into hardware and software specifications.</p><p></p><p>As a Staff Engineer Systems, you will be expected to demonstrate the following behaviors:</p><p>- Knowledge, Skills and Ability - Apply advanced technical principles, theories, and concepts.
