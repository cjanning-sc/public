One of our most challenging new fields is Transformational Computing, which combines the unique properties of superconductivity and quantum mechanics to develop radical new energy-efficient computing systems. Our team is chartered with providing the skills to transform computing beyond Moore’s Law, advancing development of computer architectures, processing/memory subsystems, and large scale high performance computing systems. You’ll work in a fast-paced team environment alongside a broad array of scientists and engineers to make these processing solutions a reality and deliver remarkable new advantages to the warfighter. We are seeking a front-end ASIC design engineer for design and verification of full-custom digital and mixed signal Superconducting Circuits. Must be proficient in Verilog, System Verilog or VHDL RTL coding, writing functional test benches and have a thorough understanding of synchronous digital design concepts. Must be able to create a functional verification plan based on requirements of the circuit. Able to generate manufacturing test vectors and manufacturing test plan. Must be knowledgeable in synthesis, SDC constraints, formal verification, and static timing. Knowledge of scan insertion and ATPG is a plus. Able to interface with place and route engineers for floor planning and clocktree constraints and timing closure. Automated place and route and physical verification knowledge is a plus. Must have strong written and oral communication skills.</div><div><p></p><h2>Responsibilities:</h2><ul><li>Circuit behavioral coding in Verilog, System Verilog or VHDL RTL.</li><li>Circuit synthesis, formal verification, and static timing using state of the art digital ASIC design tools.</li><li>Developing verification plans based on requirements of the circuit and creating circuit functional test benches in RTL.</li><li>Generating manufacturing test vectors and manufacturing circuit test plan</li><li>Help to develop automated procedures to streamline digital design procedures.</li></ul><p></p><p><u><b>This position requires onsite work at our Advanced Technology Lab in Chicago, MD.</b></u></p><p></p><p><span class="emphasis"><b><b>This position can be filled at the Principal level OR the Sr. Principal level.
