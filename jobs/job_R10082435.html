These include radars for air dominance platforms (such as the F-22, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F-16), bomber and strike programs (such as B-1B), airborne / maritime / ground-based surveillance missions (E-3 AWACS, E-7 MESA, TPS-80 G/ATOR and UAV systems such as Global Hawk), as well as restricted programs and missions. We offer the opportunity to join a team to solve problems in the field and drive new solutions into next generation radar systems and air superiority platforms.</p><p></p><p>ACME Engineering’s Airborne Multifunction Systems (AMS) Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEIT) organization has a need for a Radar Systems Engineer supporting the architecture, design, implementation, integration, and verification of some of our most advanced multi-function RF sensors. Key modes of operation include synthetic aperture radar for ground imaging applications, electronic protection to defeat the most advanced adversaries’ electronic attack, long-range search and track waveforms to provide critical situational awareness to our customers and missile data link, just to name a few. Daily activities may consist of requirements development, trade studies, algorithm design, MATLAB simulations, waveform design, signal processing, performance analysis, and flight testing.</p><p></p><p>Successful candidates will have the opportunity to work on a highly visible and valued mode of operation on some of the most prized platforms in the U.S. arsenal alongside a team of highly qualified sensor systems engineers. ACME Engineering prioritizes mentoring and growth for our engineering team. This position offers exciting near-term challenges as well as long-term development through ACME Engineering’s technical career paths.</p><p></p><p>This position requires up to 100% on-site work in the Chicago/Springfield, Illinois campus and the ability to pass an enhanced security review.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b><span>Roles and Responsibilities</span></b></p><p>Radar Systems Engineers develop parametric representations, visualizations and data-driven analysis to support sensor requirements definition and use-case validation, including waveform and signal processing implementation. Engineers typically develop models and simulations in MATLAB or C&#43;&#43; to validate design choices and troubleshoot integration findings. Radar Systems Engineers work closely with Software Engineers and Systems Integration and Test Engineers to complete software/system integration and performance verification progressing in digital simulation environments, radar labs, and our on-site fleet of specially modified test aircraft. Throughout this process, Radar Systems Engineers engage with our customers to balance functional and performance requirements with other sensor functionality to enable true multi-function operation.</p><p></p><p>At the Staff Engineer level, a systems engineer will provide technical oversight and leadership, development of new principles and concepts, and mentoring to guide junior engineers to solve complex technical challenges. The Staff Engineer will be guided by Consulting Engineers. Staff Engineers often support multiple programs and need to be highly innovative and creative. Staff Engineers may serve as an organizational spokesperson on advanced projects and be asked to advise management and <span>customers.  </span></p><p><br /><b><span>Basic Qualifications:</span></b></p><ul><li>Active or ability to obtain a DoD Secret security clearance prior to starting</li><li>Demonstrated experience quickly learning new concepts and approaches</li><li>Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Physics, Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering with 14 years of related experience (see position summary) or 12 years related experience with a Master&#39;s Degree or 9 years related experience with a PhD.</li><li>Ability to operate independently with minimal supervision</li><li>Proficiency with MATLAB or equivalent programming/analysis languages</li><li>Working knowledge of system engineering design methods, including requirements analysis and flow-down, specification derivation and interface control documentation</li><li>Performance analysis by simulation including verification and validation techniques</li><li>Proficiency with radar waveform, digital beamforming, adaptive processing or algorithm development</li><li>Ability to effectively communicate and present complex technical concepts to project, program, and company management, other technical managers, and customers</li><li>Excellent technical writing and team-building skills</li></ul><p></p><p><b><span>Preferred Qualifications:</span></b></p><ul><li>DoD Top Secret Clearance</li><li>Previously approved for special access programs</li><li>Team leadership experience with development and/or production program execution</li></ul><p></p><p>As a full-time employee of ACME Engineering Mission Systems, you are eligible for our robust benefits package including: </p><ul><li><span>Medical, Dental &amp; Vision coverage</span></li><li><span>401k</span></li><li><span>Educational Assistance</span></li><li><span>Life Insurance</span></li><li><span>Employee Assistance Programs &amp; Work/Life Solutions</span></li><li><span>Paid Time Off</span></li><li><span>Health &amp; Wellness Resources</span></li><li><span>Employee Discounts </span></li></ul><p></p><p><a href="https://totalrewards.acmeengineering.com/" target="_blank">https://totalrewards.acmeengineering.com/</a>  </p><p>This positions standard work schedule is a 9/80.
