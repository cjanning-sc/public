In support of that activity, we are seeking an<b> Analog Circuit Design Engineer</b> for design and implementation of the analog circuits which provide regulated voltages currents and sense RF signals as well as other circuit operating conditions. The analog parameters are supplied in digital form for use by the host system to allow accurate control, test and instrumentation. Most of our designs operate at radio and microwave frequencies but we also design circuits to operate in the optical frequency range from Long Wave IR to the visible part of the spectrum. For these circuits the analog circuitry is in the primary signal path and provides wide dynamic range signal processing and conversion.
