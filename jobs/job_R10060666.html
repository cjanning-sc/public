In support of that activity, we are seeking an<b> Analog Circuit Design Engineer</b> for design and implementation of the analog circuits which provide regulated voltages currents and sense RF signals as well as other circuit operating conditions. The analog parameters are supplied in digital form for use by the host system to allow accurate control, test and instrumentation. Most of our designs operate at radio and microwave frequencies but we also design circuits to operate in the optical frequency range from Long Wave IR to the visible part of the spectrum. For these circuits the analog circuitry is in the primary signal path and provides wide dynamic range signal processing and conversion.  </p><p></p><p><b>This position can be filled at the Principle Level T02 or at the Sr. Principle Level T03.</b></p><p><br /><b>Basic Qualifications:</b></p><p><b>Level 2</b></p><ul><li><p>Bachelor&#39;s degree in Electrical Engineering - ideally with some credits in Microelectronics or Semiconductor Physics</p></li><li><p>2 Years with Bachelors in Science; 0 Years with Masters</p></li><li><p>Transistor level circuit design and analysis skills</p></li><li><p>Basic understanding of fundamental semiconductor device physics</p></li><li><p>Familiar with basic analog circuits such as amplifiers, bandgap volage references, voltage regulators as well as A/D and D/A converters</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of signal processing functions such as Integrators, differentiators, and filters.</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with schematic entry and simulation tools such as Cadence Virtuoso and Spectre.
