Our products range from advanced sensing technologies to state-of-the art targeting and tracking systems that are deployed in Electro-Optical Infrared (EOIR) and Radio Frequency Electronic Warfare (RFEW) systems. These systems are designed, developed, built, integrated, and tested by the capable folks at our company to protect the lives of U.S. and allied warfighters in present and future conflicts.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Our Systems Engineering Integration &amp; Test (SEIT) organization provides complex avionics systems in Targeting, EOIR, and RF technology areas.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>There are Engineer Systems and Principal Engineer Systems opportunities available in two disciplines in SEIT supporting the Targeting and EOIR technology areas:</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Modeling &amp; Simulation: Work assignments include analysis and trade-studies of product architectures using analytical models and mission level simulations. A primary task for an engineer doing modeling and simulation is software development of in-house system models and algorithms, as well as execution of these models to characterize and analyze system performance. Strong domain knowledge combined with valuable software development skills are required to produce the accurate models and drive the critical analysis needed to design our future systems. As a member of the SEIT team, a Modeling and Simulation engineer gains a deep understanding of how our systems architecture design process meets our mission level goals.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Systems Design: Tasking can include creating and refining Model Based System Engineering products (system behavioral models, Use Case realizations, State Machines, etc.), generation and update of system and sub-system level specifications in DOORS, including requirements traceability, creation of Verification Cross Reference Matrices (VCRM), verification traceability (tracing requirements to test <span><span><span>plans/procedures/results),</span></span></span> and updating and maintenance of system drawings and documents. As a part of the SEIT team, a Systems Design engineer is exposed to the front-end of the Systems Engineering process and coordinates across many disciplines to ensure the system description and requirements are properly and thoroughly defined and captured.</span></p><p></p><p><span>This position can be filled at the Principal or Sr. Principal level: </span></p><p></p><p><b><span>Basic Qualifications for Principal Systems Engineer:</span></b></p><p><span>– BS degree in a STEM field with 5&#43; years related experience or MS degree in STEM field with 3&#43; years of related experience.</span></p><p><span>- Experience as a Systems Engineer learning and applying some of the skills mentioned above for Modeling &amp; Simulation or System Design</span></p><p><span>- Demonstrated proficiency in analytical thinking and problem-solving skills and Systems thinking mindset</span></p><p><span>- Excellent decision making and communication (written and oral) skills</span></p><p><span>- Strong work ethic and the ability to work in an integrated product team (IPT) environment</span></p><p><span>- Must have the ability to obtain a full Secret clearance and Special Access Program (SAP) clearance prior to start​</span></p><p><b><span> </span></b></p><p><b><span>Basic Qualifications for Sr. Principal Systems Engineer:</span></b></p><p><span>– BS degree in a STEM field with 9&#43; years related experience or MS degree in STEM field with 7&#43; years of related experience.</span></p><p><span>- Experience as a Systems Engineer learning and applying some of the skills mentioned above for Modeling &amp; Simulation or System Design</span></p><p><span>- Demonstrated proficiency in analytical thinking and problem-solving skills and Systems thinking mindset</span></p><p><span>- Excellent decision making and communication (written and oral) skills</span></p><p><span>- Strong work ethic and the ability to work in an integrated product team (IPT) environment</span></p><p><span>- Must have the ability to obtain a full Secret clearance and Special Access Program (SAP) clearance prior to start</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><b><span>Preferred Qualifications:</span></b></p><p><span>- Experience with Model Based Engineering (MBE) concepts and tools (Cameo, Rhapsody or similar)</span></p><p><span>- Experience with Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology</span></p><p><span>- Experience working as part of an Agile team</span></p><p><span>- Working knowledge of DOORS</span></p><p><span>- Knowledge of MATLAB, C, C&#43;&#43;, CUDA, SysML, Python, VHDL, OpenCL, or other scripting languages</span></p><p><span>- Working knowledge of one of more of the following specialty areas for integration and test related to Targeting, EOIR/RF systems: sensors/antennas, <span><span><span>transmitters/receivers,</span></span></span> optics, detection and tracking</span></p></div><div id="job_state">Wisconsin</div><div id="relocation_eligible">Yes</div><div id="virtual_telecommute">Hybrid</div><div id="creation_date">2022-08-19</div><div id="pay_range_maximum">140063</div><div id="creation_month">August</div></body></html>
