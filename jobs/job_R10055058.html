This involves serving as point of contact for factory payload experts requesting data and information; developing anomaly resolution procedures; acting as test conductor during special payload specific activities; supporting anomaly identification and resolution from initial anomaly response, through root-cause investigations and corrective actions for any anomalies associated with the payload.</p><p></p><p>Because the system is a worldwide communication system of critical importance to the nation’s defense, the payload RTAs participate in planning creative solutions to minimize operational impacts while planning major constellation activities such as new satellite insertion, Payload software upload and constellation reconfigurations.
