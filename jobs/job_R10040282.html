As part of that team, you will support design solutions for electromechanical servo systems used to implement position control for RF antennas and inertially stabilized gimbals. RF antennas require servo control for precise positioning while gimballed optical payloads require inertial stabilization for improved accuracy of collected imagery. The servo system in each application ensures precise pointing as well rejection of torque disturbances generated by the platforms such as ground, aircraft, space, etc.</p><p></p><p><b>Roles and responsibilities include:</b></p><ul><li><p>Function as the lead design engineer for one or more parts of servo control systems.  These could include the design of software and/or the hardware used for implementing control of various servo motors and mechanisms.</p></li><li><p>Support integration and testing of precision gimbal stabilized systems and radar positioner systems.</p></li><li><p>Analyze the designed control system in both time and frequency domains.
